#CEQ course evaluation

## Purpose
This is a re-design of the older design in order to make it responsive and therefore work on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets.

### Design
I've followed the old design, provided by Karim and just made it responsive. 

### Other info
This is just the frontend. There is no backend, database or rest-api communication in this application. The questions/statements in the survey are fetched from a js file, named list.js. The data is in a string array.
